  -The title and explanation of the pomodoro technique.  
  
  -The timer itself containing play/stop/restart buttons and a settings button.  

  -A motivating section using Reddit's API - https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/ 
 
 -A section indicating number of pomodoros done thus far, and how many until a long break. 

  -A section to write down your goal for each pomodoro.
